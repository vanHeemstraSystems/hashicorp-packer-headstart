## Description
Packer allows us to create templates for generating cross-platform machine images â€” templates that can be written in JSON. In this lab, we'll test our JSON skills by fixing and otherwise neatening up an inaccurately written JSON Packer template. Just want to test your JSON reviewing skills? No Packer knowledge is needed to take this lab.
