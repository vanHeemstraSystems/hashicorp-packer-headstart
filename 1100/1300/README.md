## Description
Packer allows us to create templates for generating cross-platform machine images, and HashiCorp provides its own configuration language for this task. In this lab, we'll test our HCL2 skills by fixing and otherwise neaten up an inaccurately written HCL2 Packer template. Just want to test your HCL2 reviewing skills? No Packer knowledge is needed to take this lab.
