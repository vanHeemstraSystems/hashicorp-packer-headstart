Packer is a tool for building machine images — or "compute" resources that store configuration, metadata, and permissions information for the creation of a virtual machine. Packer works cross-platform, which means we can create machine images for everything from cloud platform, like AWS, to old-school virtualization tools, like VirtualBox.

Packer does this by leveraging the tools we already use, such as our cloud platform APIs, and current configuration management tools. This means outside of learning how to write JSON- or HCL2-based Packer templates, any concepts we're introduced to won't necessarily be new — we just need to learn how to use them within our Packer template.

Packer will then take any templates we provide and produce an image, sending it straight to the appropriate platform just by running a single command.

***Wrap Up***
- Packer lets us create machine images.
- Machine images are roadmaps for virtual machine creation, ensuring our VM provisions with the appropriate configurations.
