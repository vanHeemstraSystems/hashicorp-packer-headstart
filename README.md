Course Details

## OVERVIEW
HashiCorp Packer is a lightweight open source tool for building automating machine images across multiple platforms, including AWS, Azure, and GCP as well as popular virtualization or quasi-virtiualization platforms such as Docker and VirtualBox. In this course, we'll explore the core components of a Packer build, such as builders and communicators, then learn how to leverage these components to write portable buildfiles that work with the infrastructure we're already using -- such as platform, the provisioning toolchains -- and let us improve parity between our existing environments.
